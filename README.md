# FL-IDS: Federated Learning Intrusion Detection System for Drone Swarms

This repository contains the code and experimental artifacts for **FL-IDS**, a hybrid deep learning-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) integrated with a Federated Learning (FL) framework. The system is designed to detect and mitigate network-level attacks such as DDoS in drone swarms operating in adversarial edge environments like AERPAW.

---

## Overview

The project implements a **hybrid CNN–LSTM–GRU model** trained on a customized dataset combining:
- The [Edge-IIoT Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sibasispradhan/edge-iiotset-dataset)
- Real-world DDoS and SQL injection attack traffic collected on the **AERPAW testbed**

The IDS is trained both in **centralized** and **federated settings**, and evaluated under normal, mildly congested (33%), and severely congested (66%) network scenarios.


## Dataset Details

### Edge-IIoT Dataset
- Protocols: ARP, ICMP, HTTP, TCP, UDP, DNS, MQTT, Modbus
- Labels: Binary (Attack/Normal), Multi-class (15+ attack types)
- Feature engineering includes label encoding, one-hot encoding, chi-squared feature selection, and scaling.

### AERPAW Attack Dataset
- Captured attacks: `DDoS_TCP`, `DDoS_UDP`, `DDoS_ICMP`, `DDoS_HTTP`
- Preprocessing includes categorical encoding, duplicate removal, and merge with Edge-IIoT.

## Model Architecture

- **Conv1D + MaxPooling**: Feature extraction
- **LSTM + GRU**: Captures long- and short-term temporal patterns
- **Dense + Dropout**: Regularized classification layer

## Experiments

### Goals:
- Detect and Mitigate DDoS & GPS spoofing (network-level)
- Evaluate performance under 33% and 66% attack intensities

### Environment:
- **AERPAW Testbed**
- Simulated portable drones + aggregator node
- Network tools: `iperf3`, `tc`, `hping3`

- Adversarial Training (AT)
- Federated Learning

### Network-Level:
- Hierarchical Token Bucket (HTB) Rate Limiting
- Anycast + DNAT with `iptables`
- Geometric Trajectory Validation for GPS Spoofing

## Results Snapshot

- **Binary Classification Accuracy (FL):** ~0.99
- **Multiclass Precision/Recall (centralized):** 0.93–0.97
- **DDoS Traffic Detection:** >94% accuracy under realistic conditions
- **Federated Recovery:** Maintained accuracy even with 1–3 poisoned nodes
